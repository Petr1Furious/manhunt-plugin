# Manhunt plugin

A Minecraft plugin inspired by a famous "Speedrunner vs Hunter(s)" Youtube series.

One player is selected as a speedrunner, while all the rest are hunters. The speedrunner has to finish the game by killing the Ender dragon, while hunters have to top him. If the speedrunner dies, he loses. All the hunters also get a compass, which is pointing at the speedrunner.

Any number of players is supported.

## Installation

Requires Spigot/Paper server for Minecraft 1.17.1.

Put built plugin file into the plugins folder and start the server.

## Usage

For a quick start with all players, execute "/manhunt join1 [nickname]", where "nickname" is the speedrunner name. All the other players will be chosen as hunters.

After the game finishes, the host can either finish it by running "/manhunt end" or start another round with the same speedrunner and hunters by running "/manhunt start".
